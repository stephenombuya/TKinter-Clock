# Clock with Alarm in Python

This is a simple Python project that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a clock with an alarm functionality.

## Features

* Displays real-time clock with date.
* Allows users to set an alarm time.
* Triggers an alarm notification (sound or message) when the set time is reached.

## Dependencies

* tkinter: Python library for creating GUIs.

## Running the Project

1. Save the Python code as `clock.py`.
2. Install the `tkinter` library if it's not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

3. Run the script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python clock.py
   ```


## **Usage**
The GUI displays the current time and date. You can enter an alarm time in the HH:MM format in the designated entry field and click the "Set Alarm" button. When the alarm time is reached, a message will be printed to the console indicating the alarm is ringing (you can customize this behavior to play a sound or display a notification window).

## **Customization**
This is a basic implementation, and you can extend it further by:

- Adding more features like snooze, multiple alarms, different alarm sounds, etc.
- Enhancing the GUI design with various fonts, colors, and layouts.
- Implementing error handling and input validation for the alarm time.
- Integrating the alarm functionality with other applications or services.
